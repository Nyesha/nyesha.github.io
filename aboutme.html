    <h1> Biography</h1>
    <p>Hello there, My name is Nyesha and this is my digital protfolio.
    I am currently on my way to being a Senior at Brooklyn Institute of Liberal Arts aka BILA.
    This is where you can see all my previous and ongoing coding work.
    I have plans on attending college for Fabric and Fashion Styling to pursue a career as a Fashion Stylist.
    If you want to get a tad bit more personal, I have a twin sister, a yonger brother and a half sister. 
    I really enjoy listening to overseas music specifically K-Pop, I also enjoy cooking, watching anime and bad horror/ thriller films from Netflix. </p>
